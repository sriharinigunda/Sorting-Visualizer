<h3>What is Sorting Visualizer?</h3>
<br>
        <p><i>A sorting visualizer is a tool or program that allows you to visualize how different sorting algorithms work by displaying the step-by-step process of sorting an array of elements. Sorting algorithms are methods used to organize and order data in a particular way, and a sorting visualizer can help you understand how these algorithms work by providing a visual representation of the sorting process.</i></p>
<br>
        <p><i>In a sorting visualizer, you can typically input an array of elements and choose a sorting algorithm to visualize. The visualizer will then display the array of elements and show how the sorting algorithm rearranges the elements until they are sorted in the desired order. This can be a helpful tool for learning about sorting algorithms and understanding how they work.<i>
</p>
<br>
        <p><i>Sorting visualizers are often used in computer science education to teach students about sorting algorithms and how to analyze their efficiency. They can also be used by developers and programmers to debug and optimize their code. Additionally, sorting visualizers can be used for fun and entertainment, as they can create interesting and visually appealing displays of data.<i></p>
